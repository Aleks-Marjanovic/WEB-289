## Roadmap
* Planned integration with Google Maps so users have a visual map representation of where the locations are located
* User profile pages so members can save favorite locations
* Option to filter locations based on various variables (zip code, photoshoot type, average review score...)
* Blog posts of admins covering a range of photography themes
